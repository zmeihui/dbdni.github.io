# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities.
  We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background,
  country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions,
  as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment. Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I 
  hairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.
